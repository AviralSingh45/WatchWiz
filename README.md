🎬 WatchWiz — Hybrid Movie Recommendation System

WatchWiz is a robust Hybrid Movie Recommendation System that delivers personalised movie suggestions by seamlessly combining Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering (SVD).

The system utilises real-world datasets (MovieLens & TMDB), a Python-based machine learning backend for inference, and a modern, responsive React frontend for visualisation.

Frontend URL: https://watchwiz.lovable.app/

Backend URL: https://cinematch-wwbr.onrender.com/

🚀 Key Features
🎯 Hybrid Recommendation Engine:

Content-Based: TF-IDF Vectorization & Cosine Similarity.

Collaborative: Matrix Factorisation using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition).

⚡ Real-Time Inference: High-performance API built with FastAPI.

🎨 Modern UI: A responsive interface crafted with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

📊 Performance Metrics: Evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

🧪 Real-World Data: Trained on the MovieLens 100K and TMDB 5000 datasets.

🔗 Full Integration: No mock data—all recommendations are computed dynamically.

🧠 System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture where the frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls.

▶️ Getting Started

#1. Backend Setup (Python): Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary dependencies.


cd backend pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the FastAPI server:

python -m uvicorn api:app --reload

The backend will start at: http://127.0.0.1:80002.

Frontend Setup (React)

Open a new terminal, navigate to the root (or src), and install dependencies.

npm install

Run the development server:

npm run dev

The frontend will start at: http://localhost:8080 (or the port specified by Vite).

##📡 API Reference #Get Recommendations Endpoint: GET /recommend

Query Parameters:

user_id (int): The ID of the user (from MovieLens dataset). movie (string): The title of the movie the user is currently viewing/interested in.


Example Request:


GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/recommend?user_id=1&movie=Avatar


Example Response: { "recommendations": [ "Aliens", "Titanic", "The Abyss", "Prometheus", "Avatar: The Way of Water" ] }

📊 Model Performance

We evaluate our model using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to ensure recommendation accuracy.

RMSE~0.94

Indicates predicted ratings differ from actual user ratings by less than 1 star on average.

##📦 Datasets This project is trained on the following open-source datasets:

MovieLens 100K Dataset: Used for Collaborative Filtering (User-Movie Matrix).

TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset: Used for Content-Based Filtering (Metadata, Genres, Cast).

Note on Large Files: Due to GitHub file size limitations, the trained .pkl model files and large CSV datasets are not tracked in this repository. Please refer to backend/models/README.md for instructions on how to regenerate the models locally using the provided source code.

🎓 Academic Notes
This project serves as a practical demonstration of:

Hybrid Systems: Overcoming the "Cold Start" problem by combining two filtering methods.
System Design: Decoupling ML computation (Backend) from User Interface (Frontend).
Deployment Readiness: Using production-ready frameworks (FastAPI) rather than notebook scripts.
